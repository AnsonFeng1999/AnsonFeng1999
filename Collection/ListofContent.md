</p> 

* Chain Mail is based off the classic arcade game "Centipede," but this time- you're the centipede! Control multiple chains at once and navigate to the bottom of the screen.

  Try to get your longest chain mail to the bank account to earn the most points possible!
* Game Engineer:
  * Developed enemy movement system which randomly tracking one part of the player as the target, the enemy would move towards with a random part of the player, much like a steering effect.
  * Implemented enemy attacking logic with options to change rate of fire and bullet speed.
  * Designed and created level and difficulty progression system by utilizing player score system, enemy movement system, and enemy attacking logic, providing engaging gameplay experience:
    * Each level has a different goal and the enemy would have different buff.
  * Implemented an extra enemy type which is called "agent". It moves diagonally with random direction, acting like a bullet to prevent the player to reach the target.
* C#, Unity3D
