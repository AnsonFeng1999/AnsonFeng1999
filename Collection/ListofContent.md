  <img src="https://github.com/TaihouAnF/TaihouAnF/blob/main/assets/Renderer.png"/>
</p>

* A 2D light simulator and 3D Rendering Engine with Ray-Tracing and Path-Tracing feature developed by using C.\
Detailed description can be found in the project.
* Developer and Maintainer:
  * Simulated light rays propagation (reflecting, refracting, and diffusing) in 2D with point light sources
  * Developed basic backward Ray-Tracing using local [**"Phong Model"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) and point light source
  * Improved the previous Ray-Tracer to support more features (including multi-threading, anti-aliasing, area light sources, mappings and etc)
  * Implemented Path-Tracing with Importance Sampling and Explicit light sampling
* Ray-Tracing feature passed 98% benchmark tests, and Path-Traceing feature can generate realistic picture with low level of noise
* C, Ray-Tracing, Path-Tracing, Visual Studio Code, Git
